I intend to use this repository (and also this README file) as a tool to
organize myself and my configurations. That way I can incrementally rip
whatever I like from my Manjaro configs, store it here and perhaps some day in
the near future distro-hop to Arch (either that or use Manjaro Architect).

** Configurations that can be found here

- [[./.config/i3/config][i3-gaps]]
- [[./.Xresources][URxvt]]
- [[./.config/rofi/config][rofi]]
- [[./.config/lightdm/lightdm.conf][lightdm]]
- [[./.emacs.d/config.org][Emacs]]
- [[./.zshrc][zsh]]
- [[./.config/picom.conf][picom]]
- [[./.config/dunst/dunstrc][dunst]]
- [[./.config/redshift.conf][redshift]]
- [[./.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc][sxhkd]]

** Installing

In order to clone and "install" (i.e. copy these dotfiles to their correct
location), you should use [[./.scripts/install_dotfiles.sh][this script]].

Here is it, by the way:

#+include: "./.scripts/install_dotfiles.sh"

It ensures that the repo is cloned the right way and puts an useful alias
in your =$SHELL= configuration file.
