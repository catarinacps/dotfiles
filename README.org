I intend to use this repository (and also this README file) as a tool to
organize myself and my configurations. That way I can incrementally rip
whatever I like from my Manjaro configs, store it here and perhaps some day in
the near future distro-hop to Arch (either that or use Manjaro Architect).

** Configurations that can be found here

- i3-gaps
- urxvt
- dmenu
- lightdm
- emacs
- zsh
- compton
- dunst
- redshift

** Installing

In order to clone and "install" (i.e. copy these dotfiles to their correct
location), you should use [[./.scripts/install_dotfiles.sh][this script]].

Here is it, by the way:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle yes
  # This script is supposed to be downloaded and ran BEFORE the cloning of
  # this repository, i.e. run this script to clone
  # Example usage: chmod +x ./clone_repo.sh; $SHELL ./clone_repo.sh


  gitdir="~/.cfg/"
  gitrepo='git@github.com:hcpsilva/dotfiles.git'
  gitalias="git --git-dir=$gitdir --work-tree=$HOME"

  # Set-up
  alias dotgit="'$gitalias'"
  echo "alias dotgit='$gitalias'" >> $HOME/.$(basename $SHELL)rc
  echo $gitdir >> $HOME/.gitignore

  # Cloning
  git clone --bare $gitrepo $gitdir

  # Make sure we checkout (if before where any duplicates)
  dotgit checkout -f

  # Set so that this repo can't see untracked files (otherwise madness)
  dotgit config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

  # Load up the alias
  source $HOME/.$(basename $SHELL)rc
#+END_SRC

It ensures that the repo is cloned the right way and puts an useful alias
in your =$SHELL= configuration file.
